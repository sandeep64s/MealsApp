Meal app to store and search meals.

Hoisted Link : https://sandeep64s.github.io/MealsApp/

The functionalaities are as follows :
1. Home Page : Search any meal from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions). Each search result of the meal should have a favourite button, clicking on which the meal should be added to “My favourite meals” (a list). On clicking any particular search result (any meal), open a new page with more information about that meal(meal page)
2. Meal Detail Page : Should show information about the meal like its name, photo, instructions, etc.
3. My favourite meals Page : Display a list of all the favourite meals. Make this list persistent (should have the same number of meals before and after closing the browser/refreshing the browser). Remove from favourites button: Each meal should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that meal from the list.
