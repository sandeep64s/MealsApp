Meal app to store and search meals.

The functionalaities are as follows :
1. Home Page : Search any meal from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions). Each search result of the meal should have a favourite button, clicking on which the meal should be added to “My favourite meals” (a list). On clicking any particular search result (any meal), open a new page with more information about that meal(meal page)
